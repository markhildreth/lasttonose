#Last to Nose

This repository holds the source code for the [Last to Nose](http://lasttonose.com) website.

The web site is functional as an online version of the game "[Nose Goes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noes_Goes)", which is used to identify which of a group of people will be the one to do a (typically unwanted) task. Really, I use it as a testing board for various ideas. Originally it was designed to test out how to use Flask and MongoDB. It is more recently being modified to be used on Heroku. We have even sometimes used it at work.
